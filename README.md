
##excel-testng: driving TestNG tests through MS Excel

###Introduction

*(Please note: Even though I have been using this library for my own functional testing projects, I have just now begun to work on releasing it publically. So I'm still working on documentation and modifying the code for that purpose. Please consider this a __work in progress__ and feel free to hack the code meanwhile. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me)*

If you have used [TestNG](http://testng.org) for your testing projects, you know about the features it provides as a framework for test execution, assertions and test reporting. The input to TestNG can be in form of an [XML file](http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#testng-xml) that specifies which tests/classes will be a part of test execution and the parameters to pass on to the test methods. The other ways are through command-line, ant etc. or your own code by using the TestNG object and creating your own XML classes that are a part of [org.testng.xml](http://testng.org/javadocs/org/testng/xml/package-summary.html) package.

However, for end to end functional tests, it's much easier to specify the test runs in an Excel spreadsheet. This way, the same format can be used to document the test cases as well as to execute them. This project provides a way to do that. The test cases specified in Excel spreadsheet can be easily distributed to other team members for review, even those who may not need to know about how they will be executed. Once the test classes are created and tests are specified in Excel spreadsheet(s), they can be run simply like this:

    ExcelTestNGRunner runner = new ExcelTestNGRunner("input.xls"); //this can be a single file
    			 //or a directory, in which case all spreadsheets in that directory are parsed
    runner.run();                                    //run the tests
	
The ExcelTestNGRunner parses the spreadsheet(s) (it uses [apache poi](http://poi.apache.org/), so you need to include it in the classpath), creates TestNG XmlSuite(s) using the test specifications and runs them using TestNG (which also needs to be included in the classpath), which takes care of execution and reporting. More information on how the tests need to be formatted in the spreadsheet is below. 

###Excel Test Specification

ExcelTestNGRunner parses each worksheet in the Excel file(s) into a separate suite using the included parser (ExcelSuiteParser). Each suite can have suite level parameters specified in the worksheet and the test specifications that specify which tests will be run, their name, description, parameters and the test classes. Here's how a sample test suite in Excel looks like:

![Specifying Tests in Excel](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aQJizh9H60w/T1E5AWBTUkI/AAAAAAAAABk/CcZIhp4itMw/s800/GoogleSearchTests-Excel.jpg "Specifying Tests in Excel")

The top few rows in the worksheet provide the suite information. ExcelSuiteParser looks for the string "Suite Name" and retrieves the name of the suite from next cell in the same row. Similarly, it looks for string "Suite Parameters" and retrieves suite parameters from the next cell. "Suite Configuration" is not currently used. You can customize the location of these values by providing your own map to the parser. See "Customizing Input" for more details.

To retrieve the tests that will be executed, it looks for the 1st row containing "Id" in the 1st column. This will be the header row, below which each row is a separate test. The header row and tests must have columns specifying Id, Test Name, Test Parameters and Test Configuration (which specifies the classes containing the Test methods). If "Id" is left blank, the test will not be added to the suite. Finally, it parses each row under the header row into a TestNG XmlTest and adds it to the suite. The test specifications are provided as:

- Test Name: generated by concatenating Id & Test Name
- Test Parameters: retrieved from "Test Parameters" column and need to be provided in valid properties (<key>=<value> etc.) format. You can also specify functions as parameter values and then add the logic to parse and evaluate the functions in your test classes (maybe a Base Test class)
- Test Classes: specified under "Test Configuration" column as classes property. Currently, you can only specify a single test class of which, all @Test annotated methods will be executed as a part of this test execution. I'm going to add the ability to select the test methods in later releases.

###Customizing Input

If your test cases are specified in Excel but in different format, there are 2 levels of customizations you can do with ExcelTestNGRunner on how to parse the input spreadsheet(s):

1. Custom Parser Map (currently not implemented): You can use the in-built parser but specify your own parser map, which tells the parser where it can find the suite and test data
2. Custom Parser: You can create your own parser by implementing IExcelFileParser interface. You need to parse the spreadsheet file and return a list of TestNG XmlSuites.

ExcelTestNGRunner also provides helper methods to customize the TestNG object it uses to execute tests. For example, you can specify any custom listeners using addTestNGListener() method. If you need to have more control, you can create your own TestNG object and then pass it to ExcelTestNGRunner. Please see javadocs for more details. 

###Putting it Together

You can see the project at <https://github.com/randomsync/excel-testng-demo> for a complete working demo of excel-testng to parse the input test specifications in Excel. It uses uses Selenium WebDriver to automate the testing of basic Google search functionality.

###Limitations

1. Since Excel file data cannot be as structured as XML data, there are some limitations when replicating the features of testng.xml input format. For example, in TestNG input XML, for each test you can specify the classes for test methods as well as the included and excluded methods for this run. When entered into a cell in a spreadsheet, that data can become cumbersome and void the whole point of keeping your tests in a easily readable format. This is something I'm looking to add in future. 

2. Also, there is no standard or well accepted format for writing test cases in an Excel file. Every company/project has its own way of specifying test cases. So hopefully, being able to specify a custom parser map or a parser will be helpful in cases where the included parser cannot meet the requirements, even though that means having to write the parsing logic from scratch (atleast in the latter case). One thing that can be done to make it simpler is to extend ExcelSuiteParser and override only the methods that are needed. You can also contact me if you have any suggestsions on making this easier. 

3. One thing that TestNG lacks currently (in my knowledge) is to specify dependencies through the input XML file. Even though not recommended, I find it sometimes unavoidable to have some UI tests dependent on others. One case for example, is when creating a user requires a lot of steps. So in this case, I want to validate user creation in 1 test and use that user Id in other dependent tests. I would like to specify these dependencies when running the tests, not in code and currently, it is not possible to do that.

4. Specifying groups that will be a part of a test execution is not implemented yet but individual tests that will be executed can be controlled.
